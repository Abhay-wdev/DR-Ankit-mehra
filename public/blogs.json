Urinary Tract Health for Women</h3><p>UTIs affect 50% of women. Dr. Agrawal advises:</p><ul><li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Wipe front-to-back, urinate after intercourse, stay hydrated.</li><li><strong>Recurrent UTIs:</strong> May require low-dose antibiotics or vaginal estrogen.</li><li><strong>Pelvic Floor Exercises:</strong> Kegels prevent incontinence.</li></ul><h3>4.
