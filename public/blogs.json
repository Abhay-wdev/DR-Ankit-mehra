From <strong>kidney stone prevention</strong> to <strong>prostate health</strong>, here's a comprehensive guide—with insights from <strong>Dr. Vishnu Agrawal</strong>, a leading <strong>Urologist & Laparoscopic Surgeon in Ajmer</strong>.</p><h3>1. Kidney Stone Prevention: Key Strategies</h3><p>Kidney stones affect 1 in 10 people. Dr. Vishnu Agrawal, a <strong>top urologist in Ajmer</strong>, recommends:</p><ul><li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink 3+ liters of water daily to flush your system.</li><li><strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Limit salt, oxalate-rich foods (spinach, nuts), and animal protein.</li><li><strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Severe flank pain or blood in urine? Consult a <strong>urology specialist in Ajmer</strong> immediately.</li></ul><h3>2. Prostate Health: What Every Man Should Know</h3><p>After age 50, regular prostate checks at <strong>Agrawal Clinic</strong> are essential:</p><ul><li><strong>PSA Testing:</strong> Recommended annually for men over 50 (earlier if high-risk).</li><li><strong>BPH Symptoms:</strong> Frequent urination, weak stream, or nocturia may indicate enlargement.</li><li><strong>Cancer Screening:</strong> Digital exams + PSA tests detect early signs.</li></ul><p>📌 <em>Pro Tip:</em> Don't ignore urinary changes—early intervention is key.</p><h3>3. Urinary Tract Health for Women</h3><p>UTIs affect 50% of women. Dr. Agrawal advises:</p><ul><li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Wipe front-to-back, urinate after intercourse, stay hydrated.</li><li><strong>Recurrent UTIs:</strong> May require low-dose antibiotics or vaginal estrogen.</li><li><strong>Pelvic Floor Exercises:</strong> Kegels prevent incontinence.</li></ul><h3>4. Recognizing Urological Emergencies</h3><p>When to visit a <strong>24/7 urology center in Ajmer</strong>:</p><ul><li>Inability to urinate (acute urinary retention).</li><li>Severe testicular pain (possible torsion).</li><li>Visible blood in urine (hematuria).</li></ul><h3>5. Laparoscopic Surgery Advancements</h3><p>At Agrawal Clinic, we offer minimally invasive options for:</p><ul><li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> PCNL/RIRS instead of open surgery.</li><li><strong>Prostate Issues:</strong> Laser prostatectomy with faster recovery.</li><li><strong>Urological Cancers:</strong> Precision robotic-assisted techniques.</li></ul><h3>Why Trust Dr. Vishnu Agrawal?</h3><p>Ajmer's patients choose Dr. Agrawal for:</p><ul><li>🏥 <strong>Laparoscopic Expertise:</strong> 15+ years performing minimally invasive surgeries.</li><li>💊 <strong>Personalized Treatment:</strong> Tailored plans for kidney stones, BPH, and cancers.</li><li>📱 <strong>Discreet Consultations:</strong> Confidential care for sensitive issues.</li></ul><h3>Need Urological Care?
